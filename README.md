# Dwains Lovelace Dashboard Community Addons

Welcome to the community addons repository. In this repository you'll find many addons to use inside Dwains Dashboard **v3.0** and newer.

With Dwains Dashboard Addons you can extend the dashboard functionality with addons without changing any of the dashboard cores code. This repository is a community based sketchbook of what addons other people have made.

There are a few types off addons currently available:

### Area Addon
With the **Area addon** you can add your own functionality to areas. 

### More page addon
With **More page addon** you can still add own pages to Dwains Dashboard, you even can put them in the main navbar! Letâ€™s say you want a page with some statistics or just an extra page with some cards. Then more page addons is the way to go.
